## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter from the perspective of Charon, the overworked ferryman, dealing with a sudden influx of souls killed by a new plague of 'divinely inspired bad poetry'.
- Create a side-story about Sostratos, the shade with one good line, and his centuries-long attempt to reconstruct his lost epic from the fragmented memories of other souls.
- Draft a scene where Philomela successfully haunts her murderer's wedding, but finds the experience underwhelming and bureaucratically complex.
- Write a 'prequel' vignette showing the moment of Ariston's death-by-swan from the swan's absurd, divinely-mandated perspective.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive 'Underworld Bureaucracy Simulator' where players must navigate souls through the correct filing process to get them across the river.
- Create a visualization of the 'Queue of Acheron,' showing the ever-changing, never-advancing wait times for different causes of death using real-time data.
